### PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE

Media.net Mumbai, India
Data Analyst (Python, SQL, AWS Redshift, Airflow, Superset, Tableau) July. 2023 - Aug. 2024

• Designed and implemented efficient ETL pipelines, migrating 46 alerts from Apache Superset to Apache Airflow to reduce the load
on AWS Redshift, resulting in 38% faster data retrieval and analysis for both ProdOps and DevOps team.
• Created and managed various buckets on AWS S3 to facilitate posting CSV files and images for alerts, significantly enhancing data
accessibility and storage efficiency.
• Collaborated with senior leadership to analyze one year of data on Tableau, identifying key sources for traffic volume growth and
providing actionable insights.
• Developed a dynamic bid adjustment algorithm in Python, strategically increasing bids with volume growth and reducing them
otherwise, achieving a 13% increase in overall traffic volume.

Neumann Fornaxx New Delhi, India
Software Development Intern (Python, SQL, HTML, CSS) Nov. 2022 - Feb. 2023

• Led a team of three interns to successfully complete a project at Neumann Fornax ahead of schedule.
• Scraped over 100,000 rows of data from Zomato and Swiggy using Python CRONs and BeautifulSoup for analysis.
• Designed an automated system to delete duplicate data, reducing database size by 62%.

### PERSONAL PROJECTS

Community Analysis using Graph Networks — Python, SpaCy, NetworkX (Github)
• Parsed all Percy Jackson books to extract interpersonal relationships of all characters using Named Entity Recognition.
• Created interactive network graphs, identified groups of characters using community detection, and tracked the importance of all
characters over the entire series of books.

Document Query Agent using Multi-Modal RAG — Langchain, Python, VertexAI, ChromaDB (GitHub)
• Designed and implemented a document query agent using Vertex AI, ChromaDB, and LangChain, employing multi-modal
self-reflective RAG for precise data retrieval. Integrated Tavily web search agent to effectively mitigate hallucination issues.
• Programmed the Gemini-1.5-pro model to generate summaries of unstructured data, including images and tables, storing them in
embeddings within ChromaDB.

Book Recommendation Engine — Python, NLTK, Sklearn (Github)
• Scrapped GoodReads website to retrieve information on over 1 million books.
• Developed book recommendation system using cosine similarity, TFIdvectorizer and collaborative filtering to analyze book data,
delivering five personalized recommendations aligned with user preferences based on book summaries.

### RESEARCH AND PUBLICATIONS

Enhancing Brain Tumor Detection Using Multimodal Approach May 2024
IEEE · International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning Applications
Conducted research on optimization functions to reduce false negatives in medical image analysis. Trained deep learning models, including
ResNet50, InceptionNet, and DenseNet, for brain tumor identification. Employed ensemble learning techniques, specifically weighted
majority averaging, achieving an accuracy of 96.33%. Compared the performance of Focal Tversky Loss and Dice Loss functions to identify
the optimal model for minimizing false negatives. Developed a segmentation model, ResUNet, to localize tumors in MRI scans
